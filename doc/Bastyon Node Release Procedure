There are three types of testing:
1. Blockhcain unit tests (both from Bitcoin and by Bastyon devs)
2. Load testing, increasing number of registrations, comments, ratings, follows etc. per block and measuring node response time
3. Simulating front end activity by requesting API to view, simulating large number of users. Geerating node response time with increasing load.
*For #2/#3 measure median and 99 percentile response time
4. Combining #2 & #3 simultaneously.

If results of all four tests are at least not inferior to the prior version, release passed the tests.
