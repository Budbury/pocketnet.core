------------------
Basic node information

By default, the node is installed in directories:
    Linux - /usr/bin
    Windows - %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PocketnetCore

The installation package contains two programs:
    pocketcoind                 # Node daemon
    pocketcoin-cli              # Console RPC utility for control daemon
    pocketcoin-qt               # GUI Wallet (you do NOT need to run the daemon when using the GUI Wallet)

To start a node in console mode:
    > pocketcoind <args>

See help for more flexible customization:
    > pocketcoind help


------------------
Blockhain data directory

By default, the blockchain data directory is located in the following paths:
    Linux - ~/pocketcoin/
    Windows - %APPDATA%\pocketcoin\

You can specify your directory. Start the node with the argument:
    > pocketcoind -datadir=<your_full_path>


------------------
Configuration file

You can specify daemon settings in the configuration file.

Default config file placement:
    Linux - ~/pocketcoin/pocketcoin.conf
    Windows - %APPDATA%\pocketcoin\pocketcoin.conf

An example of a minimal configuration:
    daemon=1                    # Launch daemon in background (only Linux)
    rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0        # Allow receive from all
    rpcallowip=192.168.1.0/0    # or allow receive from only your network
    rpcallowip=127.0.0.1/24     # or allow receive from only your localhost
    rpcuser=<your_rpc_login>
    rpcpassword=<your_rpc_password>


------------------
Control node with pocketcoin-cli

You can manage your site with the helpful console utility `pocketcoin-cli` which uses RPC Protocol to connect to the host.
Examples of using `pocketcoin-cli`:
    > pocketcoin-cli help                     # Show all RPC commands
    > pocketcoin-cli help <command>           # Show help for command
    > pocketcoin-cli getblockchaininfo        # General blockchaininfo
    > pocketcoin-cli getwalletinfo            # Wallet info
    > pocketcoin-cli dumpprivkey <address>    # Show private key for address

Note that if you are using your own path for blockchain data, specify the path to the directory:
    > pocketcoin-cli -datadir=<your_full_path> <command> <args>    


------------------
Staking
                            
For effective staking must have 1 or more of outow on the wallet.
When creating a block, one out is used as an input and is "frozen" for 1 hour. 

To view information about the current balance, use the `getwalletinfo` command:
    balance - available funds at the moment.
    unconfirmed_balance - unconfirmed coins
    immature_balance - outs used in staking, "frozen"

For a list of available outs, use the `listunspent` command
